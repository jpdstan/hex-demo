A project template and sample for a simple portfolio to be built within an hour. Emphasizes material design principles.

## Getting started

<!-- ### Set up your testing environment (Mac/Linux)
1. Install `npm`, [a JavaScript package manager.](https://github.com/npm/npm). Use the following command in your terminal `curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh`

2. After you install `npm`, paste this command into terminal: `npm install -g serve`. This downloads the package `serve`, a simple JavaScript package for simulating a static server on your machine. -->

#### Create your GitHub repository

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account. Sign up for one at [github.com](http://github.com).
2. Follow [this guide](https://pages.github.com/) through Step 2. If you did this correctly following link should now exist: "USERNAME.github.io" where USERNAME is replaced with your GitHub username, and you should have a new directory called `USERNAME.github.io`
3. `cd` into your newly cloned directory. 
4. Run the command `git clone https://github.com/jpdstan/hex-demo.git` in terminal
5. Paste the following command into terminal: `cd hex-demo && mv start/* .. && rm -r start`
6. Finally, open the `USERNAME.github.io` directory with your favorite text editor. You can do this by going into Finder/My Computer and right-clicking the directory and pressing "Open With". Then select your text editor.

#### Testing your changes
1. Open the `index.html` with any browser by right clicking the file and selecting "Open With"
2. Note that any changes you make to your code will not be reflected on the page until you refresh

## Deploying to GitHub pages
We will be using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to deploy our website to the web. This is a free service from GitHub that allows us to deploy any static files from our GitHub project. 

1. From your `USERNAME.github.io` directory in terminal, type in `git add -A`. Feel freeÂ to delete the `sample` directory, although this is not necessary. 

2. `git commit -m "descriptive commit message"`

3. `git push -u origin master`

4. Go to your website http://USERNAME.github.io
